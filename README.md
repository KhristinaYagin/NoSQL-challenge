Introduced to the concept of the NoSQL database with MongoDB, the leading database management system for this language. Then expand on data skills to work with non-relational documents, utilizing the PyMongo library to interface with Mongo databases using Python. Finally, we learned how to build aggregation pipelines when retrieving data, and integrate skills we have learned. This moduleâ€™s Challenge, we import a JSON file of food establishment ratings data to a MongoDB database and conduct analysis to help a food magazine make decisions about their future articles. In this lesson, we learn about NoSQL databases with a focus on MongoDB. MongoDB is a document database that has more flexibility than a structured database, like a SQL database, for storing data. It can handle both smaller, personal projects and larger-scale projects that a company might require. For this module, MongoDB is a better choice than SQL because the data we used was stored in JSON files, which is very similar to the Mongo BSON format.
